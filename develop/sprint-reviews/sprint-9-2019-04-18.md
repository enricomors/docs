* **Component**: radixdlt-swift
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
**As** a library consumer  
 **I want** to be able to connect to a Node  
 **So that** I can access the Radix network via said Node

**Scenario 1: Connect to a Node via IP address**

**Given** A Node's IP address  
 **When** I ask it about its Node Info using REST API \`/api/network\`  
 **Then** I get information so that I can open a WS connection to it.

**Scenario 2: JSON decoding error**

**Given** A Node's IP address  
 **When** I ask it about its Node Info using REST API \`/api/network\` and it return incompatible JSON  
 **Then** I can see an error speciyfing the JSON decoding error

**Scenario 3: Connect to a Node via Node Finder**

**Given** A Node Finder URL \(e.g. \`[https://betanet.radixdlt.com/node-finder](https://betanet.radixdlt.com/node-finder)\`\)  
 **When** I load the page at the given URL  
 **Then** I get an IP address I can use to connect to Node

**Scenario 4: Incorrect IP address**

**Given** an incorrect IP address \(to what was believed to be a Node\)  
 **When** I try to connect to said computer  
 **Then** I can see a connection error, or a timeout after X seconds a timeout error.

**Scenario 5: Incorrect Node Finder url**

**Given** An incorrect URL for a Node Finder \(e.g. \`google.com\` instead of \`[https://betanet.radixdlt.com/node-finder](https://betanet.radixdlt.com/node-finder)\`\)  
 **When** I parse the contents of the incorrect page  
 **Then** I get error saying that we failed to parse out the Node IP.

### RLAU-581 - Human readable serializers for JSON

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}
Implemented human readable serializers for the Core libraries. This should improve code review, code readability and unit testing.

* **Contributor**: [Florian](https://github.com/flotothemoon)
* **Component**: core
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
**As** a library and Core developer  
 **I want** to be able to just from looking at the JSON know what kind of model I should deserialize it into  
 **So that** I increase my velocity and more easily verify the correctness of my code and unit tests.

**Scenario 1: All Serialized Forms have Human-Readable Serializer**

Given any request to a node,  
 When I inspect its JSON-serialized form  
 Then I want to know what type every element by looking at it
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### RLAU-656 - Atom Metadata Constraints

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}
Implemented atom metadata constraints for the Core libraries. This scaffolding will enable the definition of network-wide Atom constraints and limits.

* **Contributor**: [Florian](https://github.com/flotothemoon)
* **Component**: core
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
As a Radix Governor,  
 I would like to be able to define **Network wide atom constraints/limits**  
 so that the network is more flexible.

**Scenario 1: Kernel Fee Constraint with Fee**

_Given that_ I have defined an Atom Kernel requiring a fee,  
 _When_ when I submit an Atom with a fee,  
 _Then_ then the Atom will be accepted

**Scenario 2: Kernel Fee Constraint without Fee**

_Given that_ I have defined an Atom Kernel requiring a fee,  
 _When_ when I submit an Atom without a fee,  
 _Then_ then the Atom will be rejected with a validation error

**Scenario 3: Kernel Size Requirement with a valid sized Atom**

_Given that_ I have defined an Atom Kernel requiring an Atom below the size limit,  
 _When_ when I submit an Atom with a valid sized Atom,  
 _Then_ then the Atom will be accepted

**Scenario 4: Kernel Size Requirement with an oversized Atom**

_Given that_ I have defined an Atom Kernel requiring an Atom below the size limit,  
 _When_ when I submit an Atom with a too large Atom,  
 _Then_ then the Atom will be rejected with a validation error
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### RLAU-640 - Metadata Constraints

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}
Implemented metadata constraints for the Core libraries. This allows the developers to define constraints based on Atom metadata.

* **Contributor**: [Florian](https://github.com/flotothemoon)
* **Component**: core
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
As a ParticleScrypt Developer  
 I would like to define constraints based on atom metadata  
 So that I can create more sophisticated state machines based on metadata such as atom size, timestamps, signatures

**Scenario 1: Atom does have required signatures**

_Given that_ I have defined an Application Constraint Scrypt requiring a specific signature in metadata,  
 _When_ when I submit an Atom with that signature,  
 _Then_ then the Atom will be accepted

**Scenario 2: Atom does not have required signatures**

_Given that_ I have defined an Atom Kernel requiring a specific signature in metadata,  
 _When_ when I submit an Atom without such a signature,  
 _Then_ then the Atom will be rejected with a validation error

**Scenario 3: Atom does have required Particle**

_Given that_ I have defined an Application Constraint Scrypt requiring a specific Particle to be present,  
 _When_ when I submit an Atom with such a Particle,  
 _Then_ then the Atom will be accepted

**Scenario 4: Atom does not have required Particle**

_Given that_ I have defined an Atom Kernel requiring a specific Particle to be present,  
 _When_ when I submit an Atom without such a Particle,  
 _Then_ then the Atom will be rejected with a validation error

**Scenario 5: Atom does have required metadata field**

_Given that_ I have defined an Application Constraint Scrypt requiring metadata field with a specific value,  
 _When_ when I submit an Atom with such a field,  
 _Then_ then the Atom will be accepted

**Scenario 6: Atom does not have required metadata field**

_Given that_ I have defined an Application Constraint Scrypt requiring metadata field with a specific value,  
 _When_ when I submit an Atom without such a field,  
 _Then_ then the Atom will be rejected with a validation error
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### RLAU-638 - Particle Static Constraints

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}
Implemented Particle static constraints for the Core libraries. This allows the developers to define static constraints which are always applied to an instance of ParticleType.

* **Contributor**: [Florian](https://github.com/flotothemoon)
* **Component**: core
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
As a Particle Developer  
 I would like to define static constraints which are ALWAYS applicable to an instance of a particleType  
 So that I can rely on the static constraints when I use these particleTypes to make more sophisticated transition constraints

**Scenario 1: Constraint for Particle Type is satisfied**

_Given that_ I have defined an Application Constraint Scrypt with a certain constraint,  
 _When_ I validate a Particle that satisfies that constraint,  
 _Then_ the Particle will be accepted

**Scenario 2: Constraint for Particle Type is not satisfied**

_Given that_ I have defined an Application Constraint Scrypt with a certain constraint,  
 _When_ I validate a Particle that does not satisfy that constraint,  
 _Then_ the Particle will be rejected with an error
