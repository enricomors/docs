### RLAU-259 - Java Library API Documentation

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}
Publish the Java client library API documentation.

* Component: docs
* Contributor: [Damian](https://github.com/bucanero)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
As a Java developer using the Radix network,  
I would like some API documentation for the library,  
So that I can effectively use it for developing my application.

Acceptance criteria:

Given that the radixdlt-java library source code has proper Javadoc documentation  
When the developer generates the docs using an automated script  
Then a set of Java docs HTML files are generated

Given that a set of Java docs HTML files are available  
When the developer commits those files to the library-api-docs GitHub doc repository  
Then the documentation articles are updated and published on GitHub pages

Given that a set of documents have been published on GitHub pages  
When a user visits [https://radixdlt.github.io/library-api-docs/java/](https://radixdlt.github.io/library-api-docs/java/)\[version\]  
Then the Javadoc API documents are visible and available for reference.

Given that a set of documents have been published on GitHub pages  
When a user visits [https://radixdlt.github.io/library-api-docs/](https://radixdlt.github.io/library-api-docs/)  
Then an index of APIs documents \(by library/version\) is visible and available for reference.

### RLAU-776 - \(Android\) List of owned assets

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}
Lists all the users' owned assets in the Android wallet.

* Component: android-wallet
* Contributor: [Marc](https://github.com/MarcRubio)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
**As** a wallet user  
**I want** to see a list with all the assets I owned  
**So that** I can have access to the assets I have already transacted with

**More**

* Assets are listed on per account basis.
* Assets with zero balance are grouped together in a expandable list \(i.e. this list is collapsed by default\)
* Probably open a new screen with the list rather than collapsable item

Acceptance criteria:

Given that I own multiple assets,  
When I open the assets screen,  
Then I see a list of all assets owned displaying their name, icon, and total owned balance

Given that I down own any assets,  
When I open the assets screen,  
Then I will be informed that I do not own any tokens

Given that we have a UI design,  
When I open the assets screen,  
Then should resemble it as much as possible

Given that I have a search box  
When search for a token \(name and symbol\),  
This should be filtered in the list

### RLAU-873 - \(Witness Service\) Network stats

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}
Adds network statistics queries to the Witness service.

* Component: witness-service
* Contributor: [László](https://github.com/laszlourszuly)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
As a Witness Service client,

I want to be able to query data on the nodes that serve the current universe,

So that I can get an understanding of the expected behaviour of the network.

**Scenario 1: Nodes info**

_Given that_ the service is operational and connected to a Radix node network,

_When_ I request information about the nodes,

_Then_ I receive information about:

* The **total number of nodes** in the network,
* The **total number of shards** in the network,
* The **nodes per core version** distribution in the network,
* The **nodes per shard span** distribution in the network.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### RLAU-874 - \(Witness Service\) Universe stats

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}
Adds universe statistics queries to the Witness service.

* Component: witness-service
* Contributor: [László](https://github.com/laszlourszuly)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
As a Witness Service client,

I want to be able to query data on the current universe,

So that I can determine which universe I’m connected to and how it’s configured.

**Scenario 1: Static info**

_Given that_ the service is operational and connected to a Radix node network,

_When_ I request the configuration data of that network,

_Then_ I receive the raw universe JSON from a random node in the network.

**Scenario 2: Snapshot transaction metrics**

_Given that_ the service is operational and connected to a Radix node network,

_When_ I request transaction metrics

_Then_ I receive information about:

* The current **transactions per second** \(TPS\) in the network,
* The number of transactions in the network for the **last moving 24 hour period**,
* The total number of transactions in the network since **beginning of time**.

**Scenario 3: Historical transaction throughput metrics**

_Given that_ the service is operational and connected to a Radix node network,

_When_ I request historical transaction throughput metrics,

_Then_ I receive a list of TPS metrics for the last 5 minutes with a granularity of 2 seconds \(i.e. the TPS value is re-calculated every two seconds\).

### RLAU-1438 - Radix-in-a-Box including UTXO database backend

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}
Adds stand-alone support to the Radix Engine, using an embedded database.

* Component: core
* Contributor: [Martin](https://github.com/mpsandiford)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
In order to provide the Radix Engine in a stand-alone configuration, an implementation is required using an embedded database.

As as an early Radix developer,  
I would like to be able to develop against the Radix Engine without the complexity of Tempo,  
So that I can test the Radix Engine with my use cases.

**Scenario 1: Running Radix-in-a-Box**

_Given that_ I have a fresh installation of Ubuntu on VirtualBox,

_When_ I follow the instructions on running Radix-in-a-Box,

_Then_ I can verify that it is running properly by retrieving the universe via an API.

**Scenario 2: Running Client Examples**

_Given that_ the Radix-in-a-Box is running properly on my machine,

_When_ I execute the example app on the java KB website [https://docs.radixdlt.com/radixdlt-java/v/betanet/guides/getting-started](https://docs.radixdlt.com/radixdlt-java/v/betanet/guides/getting-started),

_Then_ I receive the expected responses as shown in the example.

### RLAU-1494 - \(Android\) Asset transaction list

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}
Lists all the transactions from an asset in the Android wallet.

* Component: android-wallet
* Contributor: [Marc](https://github.com/MarcRubio)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
**As** a wallet user  
**I want** to see the list of transactions of an asset  
**So that** I can see the transactions that have occured

Acceptance criteria:

Given that I own multiple assets,  
When I click one of them,  
Then I navigate to a new screen and see a list of all transactions for that asset

Given that I own multiple assets,  
When I click one of them,  
Then I navigate to a new screen and see the total amount of that asset at the top

Given that I own multiple assets,  
When I receive a transaction on this scren,  
Then I see both the list and balance update automatically
