### RLAU-1118 - Add `SendMessage` action to Application Layer

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}
Adds a SendMessage action to the Swift client library.

* **Contributor**: [Alex](https://github.com/Sajjon)
* **Component**: swift library
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
**As** a library consumer  
 **I want** to be able to use Application Layer \`SendMessage\` action  
 **So that** I can add send message feature in a client

**Scenario 1: Send Message non-empty plain text**

**Given** a RadixApplicationClient  
 **When** I send a non empty message without encryption,  
 **Then** I see that action completes successfully

**Scenario 2: Send Message non-empty encrypted**

**Given** a RadixApplicationClient  
 **When** I send a non-empty message with encryption  
 **Then** I see that action completes successfully

**Scenario 3: Send Message empty encrypted**

**Given** a RadixApplicationClient  
 **When** I send an empty message with encryption  
 **Then** I see that action completes successfully

**Scenario 4: Impersonating Sender**

**Given** a RadixApplicationClient and identities Alice, Bob and Clara  
 **When** Alice tries to send a message to Bob claiming to be from Clara  
 **Then** I see that action fails with a validation error

### RLAU-1120 - Post code of Card and App code on GitHub

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}
Publish the Payment card Android demo App and source code to GitHub.

* **Contributor**: [Marc](https://github.com/MarcRubio)
* **Component**: payment card demo
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
App code requires clean up and a whole bunch of finishing touches all throughout before it can be posted. Fixes to certain things are likely necessary as well as ensuring issues which are currently present with lower resolution devices are fixed/tweaked.

Things to do:

* Hardcoded strings need to be organized into xml file which allows for easy translations.
* Refactoring of code, method names, classes etc
* Removal of bespoke code done exclusively for VOLVO
* Focus entirely on functionality for develop/betanet branch of client libraries and remove anything ALPHANET related.
* Add generic graphics \(radix logos\) which can then be easily replaced.
* Look into handling and displaying a few error scenarios which are missing such as the NFC tag not reading properly and make them look like design.

**Scenario: OpenSource**

_Given_ POS app is open source on GitHub  
 _When_ anybody navigates to github page  
 _Then_ they can view and clone project**Scenario: Useful ReadMe on GitHub page**

_Given_ POS app is open source on GitHub  
 _When_ when a anybody navigates to github page  
 _Then_ they have a useful README to get started with including cards types to use etc

### RLAU-1121 - Add `TransferTokens`action to Application Layer

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}
Adds a TransferTokens action to the Swift client library.

* **Contributor**: [Alex](https://github.com/Sajjon)
* **Component**: swift library
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
**As** a library consumer  
 **I want** to be able to use Application Layer \`TransferTokens\` action  
 **So that** I can build a wallet which can send tokens

**Scenario 1: Send Tokens Granularity of 1**

**Given** a RadixApplicationClient and identities Alice and Bob  
 **When** Alice transfer tokens she owns, to Bob  
 **Then** I see that the transfer actions completes successfully

**Scenario 2: Send Tokens of type not owned**

**Given** a RadixApplicationClient and identities Alice and Bob  
 **When** Alice **tries to** transfer tokens of some type she does **not** own, to Bob  
 **Then** I see that action fails with error \`InsufficientFunds\`

**Scenario 3: Send Tokens insufficient funds**

**Given** a RadixApplicationClient and identities Alice and Bob  
 **When** Alice **tries to** transfer tokens with a larger amount than her current balance, to Bob  
 **Then** I see that action fails with error \`InsufficientFunds\`

**Scenario 4: Send Tokens Granularity Larger than 1**

**Given** a RadixApplicationClient and identities Alice and Bob  
 **When** Alice transfer tokens she owns, having a granularity larger than 1, to Bob  
 **Then** I see that the transfer actions completes successfully

**Scenario 5: Send Tokens with incorrect granularity amount**

**Given** a RadixApplicationClient and identities Alice and Bob  
 **When** Alice **tries to** transfer an amount of tokens not being a multiple of the granularity of said token, to Bob  
 **Then** I see that action fails with an error saying that the granularity of the amount did not match the one of the Token.
