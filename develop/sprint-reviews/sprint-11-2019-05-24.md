### RLAU-1092 - Atom Subscription over Websockets

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}
Add atom subscription support over WebSockets to the Swift client library.

* **Contributor**: [Alex](https://github.com/Sajjon)
* **Component**: swift library
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
**As** a library consumer  
 **I want** to be able to subscribe to Atoms over WS  
 **So that** I retrieve all Atoms for a given Address so that I can calculate Balance

**Scenario 1: Subscribe to Atoms for Address**

**Given** a Node  
 **When** I call JSON-RPC method \`Atoms.subscribe\`  
 **Then** I can read a stream of Atom updates and handle subscription

**Scenario 2: Cancel Atom Subscription**

**Given** a Node  
 **When** I call JSON-RPC method \`Atoms.cancel\` with a \`subscriptionId\`  
 **Then** I handle the the cancellation accordingly by calling \`onComplete\` on my Observables

**Scenario 3: Subscribe using already used Subscriber Id**

**Given** a Node and an existing subsription  
 **When** I call JSON-RPC method \`Atoms.subscribe\` with the same subscriber id as before  
 **Then** I can observe an Error message saying that said subscriber Id already is in use

### RLAU-1100 - Static Sharding for Maximum Throughput Testing

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}
A quick and dirty version of static sharding for the testing maximum throughput.

* **Contributor**: [Martin](https://github.com/mpsandiford)
* **Component**: core
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
**SETUP**  
 As a node runner,  
 I want to define my shard range  
 So that can maximize the earning potential of my node.

**Scenario 1:** There is a valid shard range  
 _**Given**_ ‌that I have defined a shard range,  
 That is smaller than 2^44,  
 and that is bigger than 0,  
 _**When**_ ‌I start the node,  
 _**Then**_ ‌the Node will start successfully.

**Scenario 2**: There is a invalid shard range  
 _**Given**_ ‌that I have defined a shard range,  
 That is not a integer,  
 or that is bigger than 2^44,  
 or that is smaller than 0,  
 _**When**_ ‌I start the node,  
 _**Then**_ ‌the Node will give me an error.

_**BROADCAST OF SHARD RANGE**_  
 As a node runner,  
 I want my peers to know the shard range that I'm serving  
 So that they can send me relevant atoms

**Scenario 1:**  
 _**Given**_ ‌that I'm running a live node,  
 _**When**_ ‌join the network / periodically,  
 _**Then**_ ‌I want to include my shard range on peer discovery messages.

_**RECEIVAL OF SHARD RANGE**_  
 As a node runner,  
 I want my peers to be sending correct shard ranges to me,  
 So that I can deliver relevant atoms to them.

**Scenario 1:** Peers are sending valid shard ranges  
 _**Given**_ ‌that I am running a node,  
 _**When**_ ‌a peer sends me a shard range,  
 That is smaller than 2^44,  
 and that is bigger than 0,  
 _**Then**_ ‌I will continue talking to that node.

**Scenario 3:** Peers are sending valid shard ranges that are correct.  
 _**Given**_ ‌that I am running a node,  
 _**When**_ ‌a peer sends me a shard range,  
 That is consistent with what I know about that node in my own ledger.  
 _**Then**_ ‌I will continue talking to that node.

### RLAU-1119 - Application Layer: Get Tokens Balances for address

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}
Add a `Get Tokens Balances For Address` feature to the application layer of the Swift client library.

* **Contributor**: [Alex](https://github.com/Sajjon)
* **Component**: swift library
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
**As** a library consumer  
 **I want** to be able to use Application Layer Feature \`Get Tokens Balances For Address\`  
 **So that** I can build a wallet which can update tokens balances

**Scenario 0: Get Tokens Balance**

**Given** API methods for Atom subscription for an address from Node  
 **When** I call \`Get Tokens Balances\` for said address  
 **Then** I see a map of balances per token for said address

**Scenario 1: Same token balance from two Atom arrays with different ordering**

**Given** Two arrays of the same Atoms but with different ordering  
 **When** I calculated the token Balance for based on both arrays  
 **Then** I see that they result in the same balance.

**Scenario 2: Increase Balance of existing Token**

**Given** an observable of Token Balances for an address  
 **When** I receive more tokens of a type I already own  
 **Then** I see that my balances updates

**Scenario 3: Decrease Balance of existing Token**

**Given** an observable of Token Balances for an address  
 **When** I spend tokens of a type I already own  
 **Then** I see that my balances updates

**Scenario 4: Update Tokens Balance when receiving a new Token Type**

**Given** an observable of Token Balances for an address  
 **When** I receive tokens of a new token type  
 **Then** I see that my balances updates

### RLAU-1191 - Settings screens for editing pin, address and invoice name

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}
Add a `Settings` screen to the POS \(Point of Sale\) Android application.

* **Contributor**: [Marc](https://github.com/MarcRubio)
* **Component**: payment card demo
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
As a POS operator  
 I want a settings screen  
 So that important information can only be edited if necessary by authorised personel

**Scenario:Settings is opened, master pin is asked**

_Given_ POS app is launched and has been setup  
 _When_ when user navigates to the settings screen  
 _Then_ user is asked to input a master pin

**Scenario: Master pin is asked and correctly input**

_Given_ user is asked to input his master pin  
 _When_ when user inputs correct pin  
 _Then_ the next action for the app, whether this is to navigate to the next screen or to confirm changes successfully happens

**Scenario: Master pin is asked and incorrectly input**

_Given_ user is asked to input his master pin  
 _When_ when user inputs incorrect pin  
 _Then_ user is informed that it was an incorrect pin

**Scenario: Changing Master pin**

_Given_ master pin has to change  
 _When_ when user navigates to do this  
 _Then_ the master pin is successfully changed

**Scenario: Changing business name**

_Given_ business name has to change  
 _When_ when user navigates to do this  
 _Then_ the business name is successfully changed

**Scenario: Changing payment address**

_Given_ address has to change  
 _When_ when user navigates to do this  
 _Then_ the payment address is successfully changed

### RLAU-1308 - Make Swift lib repository public

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}
Make the Swift client library available to the public in Radix's GitHub repository.

* **Contributor**: [Alex](https://github.com/Sajjon)
* **Component**: swift library
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
**Scenario 1: README contains brief Getting Started "teaser"**

**Given** that I have access to the Swift lib repo  
 **When** I read its README  
 **Then** I see a "Getting started Teaser" section listing the coming Application Layer APIs, such as \`createToken\`, \`transferToken\` and \`getTokenBalances\`
