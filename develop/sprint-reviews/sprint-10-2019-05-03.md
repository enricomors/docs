### RLAU-1100 - Static sharding

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}
A quick and dirty first version of static sharding to increase network throughput.

* **Contributor**: [Dan](https://github.com/DanoshiFusermoto)
* **Component**: core
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
**SETUP**  
 As a node runner,  
 I want to define my shard range  
 So that can maximize the earning potential of my node.

**Scenario 1:** There is a valid shard range  
 _**Given**_ ‌that I have defined a shard range,  
 That is smaller than 2^44,  
 and that is bigger than 0,  
 _**When**_ ‌I start the node,  
 _**Then**_ ‌the Node will start successfully.

**Scenario 2**: There is a invalid shard range  
 _**Given**_ ‌that I have defined a shard range,  
 That is not a integer,  
 or that is bigger than 2^44,  
 or that is smaller than 0,  
 _**When**_ ‌I start the node,  
 _**Then**_ ‌the Node will give me an error.

**Scenario 3**: The shard range is too large for the device  
 _**Given**_ ‌that I have defined a shard range,  
 That is too big for my device,  
 _**When**_ ‌I start the node,  
 _**Then**_ ‌the Node will never be in sync.

_**BROADCAST OF SHARD RANGE**_  
 As a node runner,  
 I want my peers to know the shard range that I'm serving  
 So that they can send me relevant atoms

**Scenario 1:**  
 _**Given**_ ‌that I'm running a live node,  
 _**When**_ ‌join the network / periodically,  
 _**Then**_ ‌I want to include my shard range on peer discovery messages.

_**RECEIVAL OF SHARD RANGE**_  
 As a node runner,  
 I want my peers to be sending correct shard ranges to me,  
 So that I can deliver relevant atoms to them.

**Scenario 1:** Peers are sending valid shard ranges  
 _**Given**_ ‌that I am running a node,  
 _**When**_ ‌a peer sends me a shard range,  
 That is smaller than 2^44,  
 and that is bigger than 0,  
 _**Then**_ ‌I will continue talking to that node.

**Scenario 2:** Peers are sending invalid shard ranges  
 _**Given**_ ‌that I am running a node,  
 _**When**_ ‌a peer sends me a shard range,  
 That is not a integer,  
 or that is bigger than 2^44,  
 or that is smaller than 0,  
 _**Then**_ ‌I will tell the network about the fault with proof and stop talking to that node.

**Scenario 3:** Peers are sending valid shard ranges that are correct.  
 _**Given**_ ‌that I am running a node,  
 _**When**_ ‌a peer sends me a shard range,  
 That is consistent with what I know about that node in my own ledger.  
 _**Then**_ ‌I will continue talking to that node.

**Scenario 4**: Peers are sending valid shard ranges that are false.  
 _**Given**_ ‌that I am running a node,  
 _**When**_ ‌a peer sends me a shard range,  
 That is inconsistent with what I know about that node in my own ledger.  
 _**Then**_ ‌I will tell the network about the fault with proof and stop talking to that node.

_**RECEIVAL OF ATOMS**_  
 As a node runner,  
 I want my peers and clients to only be sending me atoms related to the shards I'm serving,  
 So that I can be efficient in my processing.

**Scenario 1:** Peers are sending valid shard ranges  
 _**Given**_ ‌that running a node,  
 and I have configured my shard range correctly,  
 _**When**_ ‌I receive an atom that is relevant to my shard range,  
 _**Then**_ ‌I will process it.

**Scenario 2:** Peers are sending me atoms that are not relevant to me  
 _**Given**_ ‌that running a node,  
 and I have configured my shard range correctly,  
 and that I have not just changed my shard range,  
 _**When**_ ‌I receive an atom that is not relevant to my shard range,  
 _**Then**_ ‌I will tell the network about the fault with proof and stop talking to that node and I will throw the atom away.

**Scenario 3**: I just changed my shard range  
 _**Given**_ ‌that running a node,  
 and I have configured my shard range correctly,  
 and I have just changed my shard range,  
 _**When**_ ‌I receive an atom that is not relevant to my shard range,  
 _**Then**_ ‌I will not tell the network about the fault with proof and not stop talking to that node, but I will throw the atom away.

**Scenario 4**: Clients are sending me atoms that are not relevant to me  
 _**Given**_ ‌that running a node,  
 and I have configured my shard range correctly,  
 and that I have not just changed my shard range,  
 _**When**_ ‌I receive an atom that is not relevant to my shard range from a client,  
 _**Then**_ ‌I will throw the atom away.

_**SENDING OF ATOMS**_  
 As a node runner _when_ I receive a new valid atom,  
 I want to gossip that atom to other nodes that serve its shards,  
 So that they can process the atom and discover any conflics that I'm not aware of.

**Scenario 1:** I send an atom to a node I know  
 _**Given**_ ‌that I'm running a live node  
 and have valitaded an atom,  
 and I know at least one node from each of the atom's shards,  
 and I can send it to at least two,  
 _**Then**_ ‌I will broadcast it to them.

**Scenario 2**: I don't know any node on that shard  
 _**Given**_ ‌that running a live node,  
 and have valitaded an atom,  
 _**When**_ ‌I receive an atom that uses a shard that I don't know of any nodes that serve that shard,  
 _**Then**_ ‌I can process it and share it with someone else - random,  
 and I don't fucking know!

**Scenario 3**: I'm at the end of the gossip  
 _**Given**_ ‌that I'm running a live node  
 and have valitaded an atom,  
 and I am at the end of the gossip tree,  
 _**Then**_ ‌I will not broadcast it.

**Scenario 4:** I can't send the atom to the nodes  
 _**Given**_ ‌that I'm running a live node  
 and have valitaded an atom,  
 and I get disconnected from the network,  
 _**Then**_ ‌I will broadcast it with best effort.

### RLAU-1107 - Initial flow foundation with simple UI interface

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}
Built a simple UI and workflow for the Android payment card app demo.

* **Contributor**: [Marc](https://github.com/MarcRubio)
* **Component**: payment card demo
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
**User story**  
 As a wallet user,  
 I want to see a User Interface with all necessary features,  
 so that I can get setup and transact with the network securely.

**Scenario: Create a barebone skeleton with minimal design flow project**

_Given_ keynote design  
 _When_ app is used  
 _Then_ I can navigate through all screens and states in a fake way with barebones design
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### RLAU-1108 - Change simple UI to actual UI that will be used

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}

* **Contributor**: [Marc](https://github.com/MarcRubio)
* **Component**: payment card demo
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
**Scenario: Change barebones/minimal design to actual design from keynote, recreate to resemble as close as possible**

_Given_ keynote design  
 _When_ app is used  
 _Then_ design with colours, style etc should ressemble it as close as possible.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### RLAU-1109 - Hook actual UI with logic to be used with radixdlt-java library + NFC communication

{% tabs %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
**Scenario: Using app with library**

_Given_ POS app is making use of the library  
 _When_ using the app  
 _Then_ a radix identity is created which can interact with the network

**Scenario: User first tap of card, unsigned atoms is built**

_Given_ POS app requests tap  
 _When_ user first taps  
 _Then_ public key is read and an unsigned atoms is created.

**Scenario: User first tap of card, unsigned atoms is built but insufficient funds**

_Given_ POS app requests tap  
 _When_ user first taps  
 _Then_ public key is read and an unsigned atoms is created but insufficient funds so user is informed

**Scenario: User second tap of card correct pin**

_Given_ user has typed correct pin  
 _When_ user taps a second time  
 _Then_ signed atom is received and is submitted to the network

**Scenario: User second tap of card incorrect pin**

_Given_ user has typed an incorrect pin  
 _When_ user taps a second time  
 _Then_ error is received from card, user requested to type pin again
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**Scenario: First time setup screens where address can be scanned from camera via qr and saved**

_Given_ POS app is launched for the first time  
 _When_ when user navigates through the flow  
 _Then_ an address where transactions are going to be sent can be scanned with the camera and saved

**Scenario: First time setup screens where address can be scanned from camera via qr and saved**

_Given_ POS app is launched for the first time  
 _When_ when user navigates through the flow  
 _Then_ an address where transactions are going to be sent can be scanned with the camera but not correct address format hence user is informed and not allowed to progress
