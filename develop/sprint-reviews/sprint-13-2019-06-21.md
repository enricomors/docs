## User stories

### RLAU-68 - Separate submitAtom and subscribeAtom APIs

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}
Update the APIs so a user is able to listen for updates about an atom even if it's not the submitter.

* **Contributor**: [Josh](https://github.com/talekhinezh)
* **Component**: core
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
**As** a node API user,  
 **I want** to be able to listen for updates about an atom even if I'm not the submitter,  
 **So that** I can check for the progress of my atom across the network

Atom Status States:  
 DOES\_NOT\_EXIST  
 PENDING\_CM\_VERIFICATION  
 PENDING\_DEPENDENCY\_VERIFICATION  
 PENDING\_MISSING\_DEPENDENCY  
 CONFLICTED  
 STORED

### Acceptance criteria

**1. Submit valid atom**

**Given that** I'm an API client  
 **When** I submit a valid atom to a node  
 **Then** I should receive a response when the node has queued the atom

**2. Submit invalid atom**

**Given that** I'm an API client  
 **When** I submit an improperly structured atom to a node  
 **Then** I should receive a response with the error

**3. Atom status stream**

**Given that** I'm a streaming API client that's connected to a node and subscribed to updates for the AID of a valid atom  
 **When** I submit the atom  
 **Then** I should see status update notifications for the atom

**4. Atom get status**

**Given that** I'm an API client  
 **When** I request for an atom status by AID  
 **Then** I should receive a response with it's current status

### RLAU-1123 - Let user search for transactions

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}
Enable Bitcoin transaction search in the 1M TPS Explorer.

* **Contributor**: [László](https://github.com/laszlourszuly)
* **Component**: explorer
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
_As an end user_,  
 _I would like to_ retrieve all processed transactions for a particular Bitcoin address,  
 _So that_ I can verify that the transactions have indeed been processed.

### Acceptance criteria

**Scenario 1: See Bitcoin address field**

_Given_ that I have pointed my browser to [https://1m.radixdlt.com](https://1m.radixdlt.com),  
 _And_ there is an ongoing test _or_ the test has just finished,  
 _When_ the page is fully loaded,  
 _Then_ I can see an empty "Bitcoin address" input field and a disabled "Watch" button.

**Scenario 2: Query Bitcoin address that has transactions**

_Given_ that I have pointed my browser to [https://1m.radixdlt.com](https://1m.radixdlt.com),  
 _And_ there is an ongoing test _or_ the test has just finished,  
 _And_ I have entered a valid address in the "Bitcoin address" field,  
 _When_ I click the "Watch" button,  
 _Then_ a progress spinner will be shown and after some time a list of transactions will appear below the input field, showing the transacted amount of BTC and the date/time of each transaction.

**Scenario 3: Query invalid Bitcoin address**

_Given_ that I have pointed my browser to [https://1m.radixdlt.com](https://1m.radixdlt.com),  
 _And_ there is an ongoing test _or_ the test has just finished,  
 _And_ I have entered an invalid address in the "Bitcoin address" field,  
 _When_ I click the "Watch" button,  
 _Then_ nothing happens and the "Watch" button remains disabled.

**Scenario 4: Query Bitcoin address that has no transactions yet**

_Given_ that I have pointed my browser to [https://1m.radixdlt.com](https://1m.radixdlt.com),  
 _And_ there is an ongoing test _or_ the test has just finished,  
 _And_ I have entered a valid address in the "Bitcoin address" field,  
 _When_ I click the "Watch" button,  
 _Then_ a progress spinner will be shown and after some time a notification is shown explaining that there aren't any processed transactions for the given address yet.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
_As an end user_,  
 _I would like to_ see an indication of the Bitcoin data is being processed by the Radix ledger,  
 _So that_ I can get an understanding of how far the test has progressed.

### Acceptance criteria

 _Then_ I can see the time the test took to execute.

**Scenario 7: Show peak TPS**

_Given_ that I have pointed my browser to [https://1m.radixdlt.com](https://1m.radixdlt.com),  
 _And_ the test has finished,  
 _When_ the page is fully loaded,  
 _Then_ I can see the peak TPS value measured during the test.

**Scenario 8: Show average TPS**

_Given_ that I have pointed my browser to [https://1m.radixdlt.com](https://1m.radixdlt.com),  
 _And_ the test has finished,

### RLAU-1214 - Expose metrics REST API endpoint

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}
Expose a REST API endpoint to get the last calculated throughput metrics for the test network.

* **Contributor**: [László](https://github.com/laszlourszuly)
* **Component**: explorer
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
_As a web app_,  
 _I want to_ get the last calculated throughput metrics for the test network from a cached web service,  
 _So that_ I and all other instances of me don't put unnecessary load on the network nodes.

**API endpoint**

GET /api/metrics

### **Acceptance criteria**

**Scenario 1: Issue valid API request**

_Given that_ the service is up and running,  
 _When_ I send an HTTP GET request to the endpoint,  
 _Then_ an HTTP 200 response with a valid JSON body is returned.

_Example JSON response:_

```javascript
{
  "type": "metrics",
  "meta": {
    "testState": "FINISHED",
    "testStart": 0123456789,
    "testStop": 9876543210,
    "progressMax": 410000000
  },
  "data": {
    "spotTps": 2000000,
    "peakTps": 2100000,
    "averageTps": 1980000,
    "progress": 409990000
  }
}
```

**Scenario 2: Invalid HTTP method**

_Given that_ the service is up and running,  
 _When_ I send an HTTP request with a method other than GET to the endpoint,  
 _Then_ an HTTP 403 response is returned that informs me about only GET requests being served.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### RLAU-1217 - Expose query REST API endpoint

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Story" %}
Expose a REST API endpoint to query processed transactions for a particular Bitcoin address.

* **Contributor**: [László](https://github.com/laszlourszuly)
* **Component**: explorer
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Criteria" %}
_As a web app_,  
 _I want to_ query processed transactions for a particular Bitcoin address from a cached web service,  
 _So that_ I and all other instances of me don't put unnecessary load on the network nodes.

**API endpoint**

GET /api/transactions/:bitcoin\_address?page=:index

The page query parameter is optional and defaults to 0 if omitted.

**Definition of a valid Bitcoin address**

* length: 25 bytes
* byte\[0\]: version, 1 or 3
* byte\[1-20\]: data, RIPEMD-160 digest
* byte\[21-24\]: checksum, double SHA-256 digest of bytes\[0-20\]

Reference: [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address)  
 Example: [http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Bitcoin/address\_validation](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Bitcoin/address_validation)

### **Acceptance criteria**

**Scenario 1: Issue valid API request**

_Given that_ the service is up and running,  
 _When_ I send an HTTP GET request to the endpoint,  
 _Then_ an HTTP 200 response with a valid, paged JSON body is returned.

_Example JSON response:_

```javascript
{
  "type": "transactions",
  "meta": {
    "page": 1
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "amount", 0.00000012,
      "bitcoinTransactionId": "abc123",
      "bitcoinBlockTimestamp": 1234567890
    }
  ]
}
```

**Scenario 2: Invalid HTTP method**

_Given that_ the service is up and running,  
 _When_ I send an HTTP request with a method other than GET to the endpoint,  
 _Then_ an HTTP 405 response is returned that informs me about only GET requests being served.

**Scenario 3: Unknown query parameters**

_Given that_ the service is up and running,  
 _When_ I send an HTTP GET request with unknown query parameters to the endpoint,  
 _Then_ all invalid query parameters are silently ignored.

**Scenario 4: Missing query parameters**

_Given that_ the service is up and running,  
 _When_ I send an HTTP GET request with a missing page query parameter to the endpoint,  
 _Then_ the first page of transactions \(for that Bitcoin address\) is returned.

**Scenario 5: Invalid page query parameter**

_Given that_ the service is up and running,  
 _When_ I send an HTTP GET request with a negative or non-integer page query parameter to the endpoint,  
 _Then_ an HTTP 400 response is returned.

**Scenario 6: Out of range page query parameter**

_Given that_ the service is up and running,  
 _When_ I send an HTTP GET request with a too large page query parameter to the endpoint,  
 _Then_ an empty list of transactions is returned.

**Scenario 7: Invalid Bitcoin address query parameter**

_Given that_ the service is up and running,  
 _When_ I send an HTTP GET request with an invalid bitcoin\_address fragment to the endpoint,  
 _Then_ an HTTP 400 response is returned.
