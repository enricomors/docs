# Economics

## **Why did you choose this distribution model? Why does the Radix Foundation receive 35% of the tokens, while Radix DLT Ltd receives 20%?**

We’ve decided to split the total supply in this matter for several reasons.  The Radix Foundation will be the entity receiving the most tokens due to the fact, that it’s a non-profit, therefore if any profit is still made, it will be only invested into the Foundation. The Foundation will be responsible for all its stakeholders, described in detail in the economic whitepaper, nevertheless, to explain the Foundations role shortly, it will be focused on further improving Radix’s ecosystem and adoption.

Radix DLT Ltd, will, on the other hand, receive tokens as payment for the 7 years of development of the Radix Platform. Please also note that employees are eligible for options.

The Foundation does not have full access to that 35% from day one, the majority will be locked day 1 and will unlocks over a 7 year schedule. The main tokens it will have available from day 1 will be a 5% token float and another 5% for use specifically as a network subsidy. Lastly, prior to launching the network, the Foundation will have the option to sell some of the token supply it holds. Any tokens that it sells in this manner will be subject to the same unlock schedule as the Genesis Community.

The Genesis Community will be receiving 25% of the total amount of tokens. The Genesis Community is a group of early contributors and supporters of the project, some of whom decided to support it back in 2013. It’s important to remember that the Genesis Community was Dan Hughes only support and help for many years, before the rebranding and introduction of Radix.

## **What’s the price of the token?**

The price will be determined shortly before distribution, based on the Foundation’s precise funding needs and community/partners suggestions, as well as the desired regulatory approach.

## **Is Radix token a stable coin?**

No. The Radix Token \(XRD\) is a fixed supply deflationary currency. It is intended to be issued and used on the Radix public ledger.

## **When and how will we be able to buy XRD? What currencies will I be able to use to buy XRD?**

That’s yet to be determined, based on regulatory approval.

## **What’s the distribution scheme of XRD?**

When the Radix Foundation launches the Radix Ledger it is expected that a total of 12Bn XRD \(100% of total supply\) will be created in the Genesis Atom.

It is suggested that the Foundation will allocate XRD from the Genesis Atom in the following way: 

**Genesis Community**: 3.0Bn XRD issued to early supporters

**Radix Foundation Locked**: 3.0Bn XRD to support the development of the Ledger and 

**Radix Foundation Float**: 0.6Bn XRD for the initial community, marketing and development 

**Radix Network Subsidy**: 0.6Bn XRD for Node Runner network security incentivization

**Radix DLT Ltd**: 2.4Bn XRD for founder and teamStable Token Reserve: 2.4Bn XRD locked to the Stable Token Reserve

## **How will the locked tokens be locked/unlocked? \(will users have the tokens upfront?\)**

Tokens coming from the Foundation Float will not be locked. Every other type of token will be locked, as detailed in the Economic Whitepaper - the tokens will be sent to relevant addresses at go-live, and locked there.

## **Why is the Stable Value Token reserve 20% of the total supply? Can you explain the method by which this number was obtained?**

Our Founder and CTO, Dan Hughes, has been researching different stability algorithms in-depth during different market cycles and arrived at the conclusion that such a reserve is sufficient to maintain a stability algorithm. In case further research proves the reserve not necessary, it will be burned.

## **Who controls the locked 20% \(the Stable Value Token Reserve\)?**

The Stable Value Token Reserve will, initially, fall under the control of the Radix Foundation. 

Once launched, The allocation of 2.4Bn XRD for the Stable Value Token Reserve would only be accessed by the stable value algorithm during extraordinary market events. Outside of this, these tokens would not enter general circulation.

In case the Foundation decided not to launch the Stable Value Token, the XRD tokens in the Reserve will be burned \(the community will receive a minimum notice of 6 months\). It is not expected that a decision to burn the Stable Value Token Reserve will be made for at least 10 years.

## **How will you secure funds?** 

  
The tokens held by The Radix Foundation will be deposited with an industry-leading, regulated, custody institution which is used by many of the largest exchanges in the world. These tokens will be secured by state-of-the-art, multi-signature security, encryption, and authentication and will benefit from insurance. We are not presently able to share details on the institution we are in commercial discussions with due to the commercial sensitivity of these discussions. This will be shared in due course.

All fiat money held by the Radix Foundation will be held in the Foundation's bank accounts.

## **How will the Stable Value Token mechanism work?**

We’re not ready to reveal the full details regarding the stable value token - it will, however, be algorithmically stabilized and based on the XRD reserve \(20% of the total supply\).

## **How will the fees work on the Radix Ledger?**

  
Fees will kick off once phase 2 \(Fees go-live\) starts. Once that phase starts, each on-ledger operation is targeted to cost 0.001 USD. Initially, the benchmark is intended to be updated daily by the Radix Foundation. It is expected that this process will involve using the previous day’s average exchange-traded price of the XRD against the US dollar.

## **Why did you decide to introduce a network subsidy?**

Firstly, it was a strong point brought up by the community as an additional incentive to run a Radix node, while the network will still be feeless or the network isn’t big enough to support nodes solely by transaction fees. This grant will be administered by the Foundation - nevertheless, other nodes will still be able to earn fee transactions. The details of how will the network subsidy work are outlined in the Economic Whitepaper.

## **What are the locking schedules?** 

| **Scheme** | **Token Grant** | **Unlocking Schedule** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Genesis Community** | **3Bn XRD** | **1/365 daily** |
| **Radix Foundation Float** | **0.6Bn XRD** | **None** |
| **Radix Network Subsidy** | **0.6Bn XRD** | **None** |
| **Radix Foundation Lock** | **3Bn XRD** | **1 year lock, then 1/2190 daily** |
| **Radix DLT Limited** | **2.4Bn XRD** | **1 year lock, then 1/1095 daily** |
| **Stable Token Reserve** | **3Bn XRD** | **Locked until the release of Stable Value Token** |
