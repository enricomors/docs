## General

### What is Radix?

Radix is a **fast** and **scalable** platform for building decentralized applications, tokens and coins.

It is new platform, similar to Bitcoin or Ethereum, but scalable and easy to build on. Instead of using blockchain, we started from scratch with a completely new design so that every person and device in the world could use Radix without centralization or compromise. We created building blocks, making applications, tokens and coins as easy to deploy as possible. It’s fast, it works and our test net is already live.

### How is it different from other platforms?

Radix offers a novel distributed ledger architecture for decentralized applications, that is [sharded to scale](http://www.radixdlt.com/post/sharding-in-radix/) in an efficient, unbounded linear fashion combined with a secure consensus algorithm called [Tempo](../whitepapers/tempo.md).

Radix scales linearly as new nodes join the network using the theory of [sharding](../glossary.md#shard), but without compromising on decentralization or security. It enables resource-restricted devices to run a Radix node like on the Raspberry Pi. This enables inexpensive transactions at incredible speeds with near-instant finality.[ Read more here.](../platform/#how-is-radix-different)

### What is Tempo?

[Tempo](../whitepapers/tempo.md) is a combined data architecture and secure consensus algorithm that is both, [sharded to scale](http://www.radixdlt.com/post/sharding-in-radix/) linearly and secured by a novel consensus algorithm based on [Leslie Lamport's logical clock theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamps).  
[Read more here](../platform/tempo.md).

### What problems does it solve?

Tempo solves the [trilemma of decentralization](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQs#this-sounds-like-theres-some-kind-of-scalability-trilemma-at-play-what-is-this-trilemma-and-can-we-break-through-it). It scales without compromising on decentralization and security. [Read more here.](../platform/tempo.md#scaling-distributed-ledgers)

### What features does it have?

Radix is fast, scalable, efficient, secure and highly decentralized. [Read more about the Radix features](../platform/tempo.md#properties-of-tempo).

### How does it work?

Radix works on Leslie Lamport's [logical clock](../glossary.md#logical-clock) theory. [Read more here.](../platform/#how-does-radix-work-simplified)

### What is the Atom Model?

The [atom model](../architecture/atom-structure.md) is an abstraction layer on top of the Tempo ledger designed to give the most power and ease of use to users of the system. More information will be published in the upcoming security white paper.

### Why should I build on the Radix Public Network?

Radix makes it easy for developers to build most [use-cases](../use-cases/) without smart-contracts and without worrying about blockchain scalability or expensive fees. It is fast, scalable, and simple to use. [Start building with Radix.](../../develop/network/live-platform-overview.md)

### Who invented Radix?

_Daniel Hughes, chief technical officer of Radix DLT invented the Radix platform and ‘Tempo’ - it’s underlying engine._

In 2011 Dan Hughes, the founder of Radix, discovered Bitcoin and was instantly hooked by the underlying elegance of its distributed protocol. Having tested the limits of distributed ledgers based on blockchains, block-trees, and directed acyclic graphs\(DAG\), he found they all had a fundamental inability to scale. He dedicated his time developing a highly scalable distributed ledger technology platform. Five years in R&D and after many iterations he eventually invented ‘[Tempo](../whitepapers/tempo.md)’ - a novel distributed ledger architecture for trustless systems, that is sharded to scale in an efficient, unbounded linear fashion.  


### How will I benefit?

Radix enables **merchants** to [accept cryptocurrencies](../use-cases/card-payment-system.md) without worrying about wild price swings. It helps **developers** to build applications that demand transaction rates beyond today’s blockchains. And last but not the least, it allows **everyone** to participate in ‘mining’ without special hardware and complex software setups.

**Merchants**

Radix provides &lt;5 seconds settlement times with fixed micro fee. It provides merchants the ability to [accept payments](../use-cases/card-payment-system.md) globally without friction. The Radix token is a stable cryptocurrency specifically designed to help protect merchants from wild price swings and incentivize them to accept and use Radix in their everyday business.

**Developers**

The Radix platform will enable developers to create, distribute and manage highly scalable distributed applications for both public and private networks. Developers can easily build applications without worrying about expensive smart contracts. The Radix protocol scales linearly with all applications on the network run asynchronously without worrying about scaling limits of the underlying protocol. 

**Miners**

[Nodes](../glossary.md#nodes) get rewarded for maintaining the public network. As Radix does not use PoW/PoS to secure its decentralized ledger, the Radix node can run on devices like Raspberry Pi. Validators don't require special hardware, or access to capital to start. Radix reduces the barrier to entry by helping anyone with standard commercial hardware to run a node and makes it fair for everyone by eliminating mining cartels.  

### How is Radix funded?

Radix is funded by our founder and CTO Daniel Hughes. He has also raised a round from a small community of early crypto enthusiasts back in 2013/2014. Funding details will be made available before going live.

### Is Radix open source?

No, Radix is not open-source yet. It will be open-sourced to support further development of the Radix Public Network in the future. Private deployments will be licensed. Additionally, we are actively working with individuals and institutions to audit and peer-review the code before we launch.

### Why is Radix not open source?

Radix will be open source after launch. Right now the team is focused on testing and optimizing the platform.

### Can Radix scale to become a major payment network?

Our internal tests show that we scale beyond 25,000 tx/s, the average number of transactions processed by VISA. Combined with a fast transaction settlement time of less than 5 seconds, we already rival the current payment network rails and fiat transaction settlement times. 

### When will the tokens be available for purchase?

Tokens will be available when we go live in Q4 2019; you can register your interest here - [https://radixdlt.typeform.com/to/nyKvMV?source=HomePage](https://radixdlt.typeform.com/to/nyKvMV?source=HomePage) and we will send out details closer to the time.

### What is the starting price of the token?

To be decided ...

### What is the starting supply of tokens?

To be decided ...

### How do I benefit from the Radix Stable Token?

The Radix stable coin is a low volatile token that is governed by a decentralized monetary supply policy. This policy mints or burns the tokens based on demand. Demand data is supplied by the decentralized exchange to this policy which creates an elastic supply, dampening the volatile spikes without affecting the long term price curve. This allows the creation of a true crypto stable coin, one which is not pegged to fiat currencies, assets or basket of goods. It also helps combat price manipulation. 

### What is the maximum supply?

To be decided ...

### How much will Radix token cost?

To be decided ...

### How, where and when can I buy Radix tokens?

You will be able to buy the Radix tokens from the decentralized exchange, which is integrated in the protocol, when we launch our mainnet. 

### How can I earn Radix tokens?

You can earn Radix tokens by running a node or holding Radix tokens both. [Read this incentive whitepaper for more details](https://papers.radixdlt.com/incentives/latest/#abstract).

### How do  I store the Radix Tokens?

We have released both desktop and mobile wallets to store Radix tokens. [Download and take them for a test ride here.](https://radixdlt.com/wallet)

### What determines the price of the Radix token?

There are several different token types that can be issued on the Radix network.

One of the most hotly anticipated is the Radix low volatility coin, which, when launched will have a starting value set to 1 USD/token. The coin value will be 'relatively' stable, not pegged \(ie. it is NOT fixed at $1 forever\). 

Over the longer term, the price will increase in a controlled manner if there is a sustained imbalance between the supply side and the demand side. The higher the sustained imbalance to the demand side, the higher the price and the more tokens will be in circulation. The price discovery process will allow it to float up/down, but the economics will attempt to smooth out the peaks and troughs to reduce volatility.

This is still an experimental coin type and the full details will be released in a coming Economics White Paper.

### When are you going to release the economics white paper?

The Economics White Paper will be published before the launch of the main Radix network.

### Is Radix token a pegged stable coin?

No, not quite. Radix has several token types that are possible to create on the Radix platform. One of these tokens is the Radix low volatility coin, which aims to create a token with a more predictable, less volatile value to make it more useful as a currency. This Radix token will have an elastic supply based on ‘Quantity Theory of Money’.

### How is new token supply distributed?

The Radix low volatility token is based on 'Quantity Theory of Money' which is a elastic token supply model. When new supply is generated due to increased token demand, 50% of new Radix tokens will be distributed to balance holders, and 50% to Node operators.

### Who will generate or burn the Radix Low Volatility Token?

The Radix algorithmic monetary supply policy will dictate creation or destruction of the Radix native tokens via its integrated decentralized exchange.  Full details of the Radix Low Volatility Token will be released with the coming Economics White Paper.
