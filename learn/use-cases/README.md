# Use Cases

The Radix Ledger is currently in _Alpha_: the network includes only the ability to send and receive transactions and send encrypted and unencrypted messages via the client libraries. These features represent only a small number of the complete feature set that will be available on the full Radix network. However, with these simple features, some interesting applications can be built already.

This section of the Knowledge Base will take you through some basic ideas of how you can use the encrypted and unencrypted data particles with the Radix address space to make some simple decentralized applications.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** some of the use cases outlined in this section are not yet available to build on our Alphanet and require access to the Radix Betanet to be built and tested. The use cases that cannot be built on our Alphanet have a **\(Beta\)** in their titles.

We are currently in the private testing phase of the Betanet - if you would like to be involved, please apply for specific access to the use case that is most relevant to your application, and we will support you as best we can ahead of the release of the Betanet.
