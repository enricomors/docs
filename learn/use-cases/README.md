# Use Cases

The Radix Ledger is currently in _Alpha_: the network includes only the ability to send and receive transactions and send encrypted and unencrypted messages via the client libraries. These features represent only a small number of the complete feature set that will be available on the full Radix network. However, with these simple features, some interesting applications can be built already.

This section of the Knowledge Base will take you through some basic ideas of how you can use the encrypted and unencrypted data particles with the Radix address space to make some simple decentralized applications:
